  <title>EVM Analyzer Benchmark Suite Reports</title>
    <body>
      <h1>Overview</h1>
      <p>Below are links to some reports produced by runner code in
	<a href="https://github.com/EthereumAnalysisBenchmarks/evm-analyzer-bench-suitesbenchmark-suite">Solidity Benchmark suites for evaluating EVM code analysis tools and code to run the suites</a>. See instructions there for:
	<ul>
	  <li>how to add a test benchmark suite</li>
	  <li>how to update a test benchmark suite</li>
	  <li>how to create a report for a given analyzer (like Mythril or Manitcore)</li>
	</ul>
	</p>
      <h1>The Reports</h1>
      <h2><a href="Suhabe/index.html">Suhabe Benchmark Suite</a></h2>
      <p>Adapted from the
	repositories <a href="https://github.com/ConsenSys/evm-analyzer-benchmark-suite">readme</a>:
	This repo keeps benchmarks for evaluating the precision of EVM
	code analysis tools. If you have a benchmark that you would
	like to contribute, please submit it as a pull request. Please
	open an issue if you have any suggestions or feedback, or
	contact <mailto: diligence-core@consensys.net/>.
      <h2><a href="nssc/index.html">(Not so) Smart Contracts Benchmark
	  Suite</a></h2>
      <p>Adapted from the
	repository's <a href="https://github.com/trailofbits/not-so-smart-contracts">read
	me</a>: This repository contains examples of common Ethereum
	smart contract vulnerabilities, including code from real smart
	contracts.</p>
      <h2>Best-Practices Benchmark Suite</h2>
      <p>This is a placeholder for suite(s) that should be handled,
      but for whatever reason we don't have in right now. The idea
      would be to check for linter kinds of things such as "function
      visibility not set" or "compiler version not locked".
